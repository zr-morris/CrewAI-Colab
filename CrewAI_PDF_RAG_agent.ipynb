Automotive Segment: \nThis segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles, as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. It also includes services like sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue, and retail merchandise.\n\nFinancial Performance:\n- Total Revenues: The total revenues for the automotive segment was $77,553 million.\n- Gross Profit: The gross profit for the automotive segment was $16,030 million.\n- Gross Margin: The gross margin for the automotive segment decreased from 28.5% in the previous year to 19.4%.\n\nThe decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a lower average selling price on the vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in the average combined cost per unit of the vehicles.\n\n2. Energy Generation and Storage Segment: \nThis segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services.\n\nFinancial Performance:\n- Total Revenues: The total revenues for the energy generation and storage segment was $6,035 million, indicating a 54% increase from the previous year primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack.\n- Gross Profit: The gross profit for the energy generation and storage segment was $1,141 million.\n- Gross Margin: The gross margin for the energy generation and storage segment has increased from 7.4% to 18.9%.\n\nIn terms of overall performance, the company's total gross profit was $17,660 million, with a total gross margin of 18.2%. \n\nIn conclusion, both operating segments of the company have shown robust financial performance over the year, with significant increases in revenue and gross profit. However, there was a decrease in the gross margin for the automotive segment due to lower average selling prices for the vehicles."

This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.

CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws. Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews.
